---------------------------

**Who?** 

My name is Hayk Darbinyan, I'm a Mechanical Engineering student from the argentinian Patagonia 🏕🗻🌲.


**What?**

So far:

Kassen - https://kassen.herokuapp.com where I monitor my own greenhouse, at least until I can start putting these things in other people's greenhouses. You can check out my greenhouse with the username and password "guest123" 🌷🌼🌺.

Pretty Kitty Twitty - https://prettykittytwitty.herokuapp.com where you can sign in with Twitter and upload pictures of cats (exclusively) which will then be periodically tweeted from your own account 🐱🐱🐱. The website works well and you can upload pictures, but the cronjob for tweeting them out is disabled. 

Currently working on transforming the Solar Water Heater controller I made for my own water heater into a more professional product which other people could use which I will (hopefully) release as an Android and iPhone app 💧🌞🌈.


**How?**

Learnt NodeJS serverside Javascript in the last couple of months, have also been working with the esp8266 microcontroller for IoT development for a while now.

Web frontend design so far has been done in basic HTML, CSS and vanilla JS, mobile apps have been done in React-Native, although no github repo for those yet.


**Where?**

Well, here, mostly.

But if you want to contact me for questions or inquires about literally anything you can always bother me at haykodarb@gmail.com

**When?**

Is this format still working? Ah, well, regardless, every other day mostly.
