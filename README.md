---------------------------

**Who?** 

My name is Hayk Darbinyan, I'm a Mechanical Engineering student from the argentinian Patagonia 🏕🗻🌲.


**What?**

So far:

Kassen - https://kassen.herokuapp.com where I monitor my own greenhouse, at least until I can start putting these things in other people's greenhouses. You can check out my greenhouse with the username and password "guest123" 🌷🌼🌺.

Pretty Kitty Twitty - https://prettykittytwitty.herokuapp.com where you can sign in with Twitter and upload pictures of cats (exclusively) which will then be periodically tweeted from your own account 🐱🐱🐱. The website works well and you can upload pictures, but the cronjob for tweeting them out is disabled. 

Currently working on transforming the Solar Water Heater controller I made for my own water heater into a more professional product which other people could use which I will (hopefully) release as an Android and iPhone app 💧🌞🌈.


**How?**

Learnt NodeJS serverside Javascript in the last couple of months, have also been working with the  esp8266 microcontroller for IoT development.

Frontend design so far has been done in very basic HTML, CSS and vanilla JS, but I'm halfway through learning React so this should improve soon.


**Where?**

Well, here, mostly.

But if you want to contact me for questions or inquires about literally anything you can always bother me at haykodarb@gmail.com

If you're an employer, please don't go to my Twitter account :)

**When?**

Is this format still working? Ah, well, regardless, every other day mostly. 
Might actually try having a life once in a while when summer comes and quarantine ends.
