**Who tf?** 

My name is Hayk Darbinyan, I'm a Mechanical Engineering student from the argentinian Patagonia 🏕🗻🌲.


**What tf?**

So far:

Kassen - https://kassen.herokuapp.com where I monitor my own greenhouse, at least until I can start putting these things in other people's greenhouses. You can check out my greenhouse with the username and password "guest123" 🌷🌼🌺.

Pretty Kitty Twitty - https://prettykittytwitty.herokuapp.com where you can sign in with Twitter and upload pictures of cats (exclusively) which will then be periodically tweeted from your own account 🐱🐱🐱. 

Currently working on transforming the Solar Water Heater controller I made for my own water heater into a more professional product which other people could use which I will (hopefully) release as an Android and iPhone app 💧🌞🌈.


**How tf?**

Serverside development is made in Node.js, firmware for the electronics is made in the Arduino framework until I learn to code these things in C.
Frontend design so far has been done in very basic HTML, CSS and vanilla JS, but I'm learning React (Native, as of yet) so this should improve soon.


**Where tf?**

Well, here, mostly.

Is this joke format still working? Ah, well, regardless, every other day mostly. 
Might actually try having a life once in a while when summer comes and quarantine ends.
